The Purchase Subscription application runs in the same way than the Sale Subscription application.
It allows you to automatically generate invoices in draft state at a chosen time frequency.
To use this feature, you need to create purchase subscription products (to be configured on your product).
You will then be able to create a subscription for this item which generates invoices with fixed prices or a price of 0â‚¬ if the amount is unknown.
You will indicate the amount subsequently on the draft invoice that was generated.
You can also choose the frequency of subscription by month / trimester / year and your invoice will then be created accordingly.
This application allows you to save time in the encoding of supplier invoices but also to have an overview of your future expenses in order to avoid late payments or unpaid invoices for example.
